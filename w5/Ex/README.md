# Exercise

* Make a queue that holds integers. The size 
of the queue is fixed to 10. 

* Read integers separated by spaces from 
the standard input, and add them to the 
queue. When the program reads the 11th 
integer, the queue is already full. So the 
program removes the first integer and 
adds the 11th integer. Print the removed 
integer to the standard output.

* Process all the integers in this way.
