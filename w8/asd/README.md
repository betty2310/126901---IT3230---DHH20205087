* A binary can represent an arithmetic expression: The leaves are operands and the other nodes are operators.

* The left and right subtrees of an operator node represent subexpressions that must be evaluated before applying the operator at the root of the subtree.

* For example: `!a+(b-c)/d`

* Write a program create a tree representing this expression
